              The beginning of the process where I identify requirements of the app. Also known as the “consultation”.
              This usually in the form of a business call or in person meeting, depending on the clients location. This
              part of the process is used to create the scope of the project. Scope is the defined features and
              functions of the product. An estimate of how long the project will take is also determined here.

            <p class="grey-text">
              This is where I contact one of my designers to produce visuals of each page in your app. This includes
              buttons, text, icons, colors, fonts, etc. If the visuals are not to your liking, I will reach back out to
              my designer until you are satisfied with how your app looks.

            <p class="grey-text">
              With the scope established as well as the designs finalized, I can now begin to code your project. I code
              in Flutter, which allows me to create iOS and Android apps simultaneously, so you never have to worry
              about either platform having differences.

            <p class="grey-text">
              To ensure your app is working correctly, we will test your app thoroughly during this period. This
              includes testing among a select group of users that you specify, usually by email.

            <h5 class="font-bold">Step 5. Deployment</h5>
            <p class="grey-text">
              Once the application has completed all previous steps with satisfactions, it is now time to upload the app
              to the market to be public for everyone. Deployment for Android apps usually takes 1-3 days, whereas an
              iOS app may take 3-7 days. Things like app description, app icon, privacy policy, support url, and
              anything else to describe the app is needed here.
